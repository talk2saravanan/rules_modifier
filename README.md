rules_modifier
==============

Requirement

We would like you to write a script that matches rules from a security group for EC2 and update it. For example I have a security group called "database-servers" that have many rules. We want all rules that has the source "100.100.100.100/32" to be updated to "200.200.200.200/32". You may code it in a your language of choice. Assume the user will be running it on the command line.
